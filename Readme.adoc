== 🌱 Maintainer notes

This is a fork of the https://github.com/meonkeys/shb[original English version], and should be maintained as such as long as it is convenient to do so.
This means making structural changes (e.g. build system, dependencies) upstream (in `meonkeys/shb`) and merging them here.
In short:

. Make the desired changes upstream.
. Create or update a branch in your working copy of `meonkeys/shb-de` with its tip at the desired upstream version.
. Merge that branch into `main`.

See https://github.com/meonkeys/shb-de/commit/2b1f935303f26e02ff57301dbbc309b74fb2bba3[2b1f9353] for an example of this.
Some changes will conflict and must be manually resolved/ignored, e.g. `Readme.adoc`, `book/steadfast.asciidoc`, and changes to files and folders not present in this fork.
