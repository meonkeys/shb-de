= 📖 Steadfast Self-Hosting, auf Deutsch
:hide-uri-scheme:

German translation of https://github.com/meonkeys/shb[Steadfast Self-Hosting].

== 🗒️ Translator notes

When it comes to L10n and i18n, we get whatever Asciidoctor provides.
Here are some conventions and caveats for future translators.

For quoting, use literal UTF-8 characters for typographic/curved double-quotes, e.g. `„richtigen“`.

For pauses, use literal UTF-8 en dash (U+2013) surrounded by spaces, e.g. `ins Internet – und wichtige`.

Date/time values are not localized.
Example: `Dieses Buch wurde am Tue May 27 11:39:42 AM PDT 2025 mit LANG auf Einstellung de_DE.UTF-8...`.

== 📑 to do

* [ ] translate the word "Colophon"
* [ ] translate figures, e.g. "Layers of a Steadfast system"
* [ ] figure out if section references can be customized -- currently they use English-style double-quotes
* [ ] change locale for `date` command in `book/build.sh`
